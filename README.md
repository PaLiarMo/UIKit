# Mobile Design Recommendation
This repository provides structured guidelines for preparing and organizing Figma components for mobile app development, with a long-term vision of building a unified design system.
It includes:

 	â€¢	Figma file with component examples and annotation standards
 	â€¢	Layer & asset naming conventions for better developer handoff
	â€¢	Spacing, sizing, and responsive behavior rules
	â€¢	Best practices to avoid discrepancies between design and implementation
 

# Future goal:
Create a cross-platform design system where components defined in Figma have direct equivalents in Android (Jetpack Compose / Views) and iOS (SwiftUI / UIKit), ensuring:

 	â€¢	Visual and behavioral consistency
	â€¢	Single source of truth for UI
	â€¢	Faster delivery and reduced rework
